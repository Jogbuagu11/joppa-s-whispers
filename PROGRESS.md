## Assumptions to confirm

- Bundle ID `com.whispersofjoppa.game` used as given (SETUP_CHECKLIST says to choose one — Jennifer provided it).
- App Store App ID `6819075333` noted. Xcode signing will be set up when Jennifer signs in to Xcode with her Apple ID (SETUP_CHECKLIST Phase 3).
- Firebase config files (GoogleService-Info.plist and google-services.json) are in the project root — they need to be moved to the correct platform folders at Milestone 19 when Firebase is wired up.
- The Firebase service account JSON in the project root (`whispers-of-joppa-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-e2d2604c8c.json`) is excluded from git and will be stored as a Supabase Edge Function secret at Milestone 19.
- `flutterfire configure` will be run at Milestone 19 to generate proper Firebase config files.

## Waiting on Jennifer

- **Xcode setup**: Open Xcode, accept the license, install iOS Simulator runtime (needed for iOS Simulator testing). Tell me "Xcode ready" when done.
- **Android emulator**: Confirm an Android emulator (recent Pixel) is created in Android Studio Device Manager (from SETUP_CHECKLIST Phase 1). Tell me "emulator ready" when done.
